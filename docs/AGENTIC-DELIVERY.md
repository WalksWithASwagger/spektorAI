# Agentic Delivery Contract

This repo uses GitHub as execution truth and Linear as planning/status truth. v1 turns a qualified GitHub issue into a tested PR. It does not auto-merge.

## Repo Identity

- GitHub repo: `WalksWithASwagger/spektorAI`
- Linear team: `Bc-ai` (`BC`)
- Linear project: `WhisperForge Roadmap`
- Canonical local root: `/Users/kk/Code/spektorAI`

## Labels

- Ready: `agent:ready`
- Ready aliases accepted for migration: `auto-implement`, `autonomous`
- Review: `review-ready`
- Stop labels: `needs-human`, `blocked`, `in-progress`

New work should use `agent:ready`. The issue quality workflow normalizes aliases to `agent:ready`.

## Required Issue Shape

An issue can only keep a ready label when it includes all required sections:

- `## Context`
- `## Acceptance Criteria`
- `## Tests/Evals`
- `## Verification`
- `## Agent Instructions`
- `## Out of Scope`

Acceptance criteria must include Markdown checkboxes. The linter rejects ready issues missing tests/evals or other required sections.

## WhisperForge Handoff Drafts

WhisperForge handoff exports use the same issue-body contract. The Review tab's
Agent handoff draft preview can render a GitHub/Linear-ready Markdown draft from
a capture, transcript, or selected output and persist it under
`.cache/runs/<run_id>/handoffs/` before any external tracker record is created.

Draft generation is intentionally dry-run only in v1. Creating GitHub or Linear
issues remains a separate explicit user action after the draft has been reviewed.

## Runner Flow

1. A human or chat command creates a complete GitHub issue and matching Linear issue.
2. `agent:ready` triggers `.github/workflows/agentic-issue-quality.yml`.
3. If quality passes, `.github/workflows/agentic-dev-loop.yml` may run.
4. The dev loop checks pause controls, stop labels, issue quality, clean worktree state, provider output, repo verification commands, and diff limits.
5. If verification passes and the diff is within 20 files and 500 changed lines, the runner opens a PR on `codex/<linear-key-or-issue>-<slug>`.
6. `.github/workflows/agentic-pr-review.yml` comments an acceptance verdict and applies `review-ready` or `needs-human`.
7. A human reviews and merges. v1 never auto-merges.

## Verification Commands

- `make test`

## Pause Controls

Use either control to stop new dev-loop work:

- Add `.dev-loop-pause` at the repo root.
- Set the Actions variable `LOOP_PAUSED` to a truthy value.

Repos without provider secrets remain dry-run only through the `noop` adapter.

## Provider Adapter

Config lives in [`agentic/contract.json`](../agentic/contract.json). v1 supports:

- `noop`: deterministic dry-run with no file changes.
- `command`: runs the command in `AGENTIC_PROVIDER_COMMAND`.

Real providers must be selected through repo variables/secrets, not hardcoded in scripts.

## Break Glass

To disable the system:

1. Set `LOOP_PAUSED=true` in Actions variables.
2. Add or commit `.dev-loop-pause` for an immediate repo-local hard stop.
3. Remove `agent:ready`, `auto-implement`, and `autonomous` labels from active issues.
4. Add `needs-human` to active agentic issues and PRs.
5. Disable `agentic-dev-loop.yml` in GitHub Actions if labels are still being applied externally.

## Local Commands

```bash
python3 scripts/agentic/issue_lint.py --issue-file issue.md --labels agent:ready
python3 scripts/agentic/dev_loop.py --issue-number 1 --issue-title "Example" --issue-file issue.md --labels agent:ready --provider noop
python3 scripts/agentic/ensure_labels.py --dry-run
python3 -m pytest tests/agentic
